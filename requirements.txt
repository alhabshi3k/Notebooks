# === other Tools ::  GUI based on markdown/ hmtl/ css / JS -----
ipyscript # A Custom Jupyter Widget Library for PyScript.
flexx # is a pure Python toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIâ€™s), 
      # that uses web technology for its rendering. Apps are written purely in Python; 
      # The PScript transpiler generates the necessary JavaScript on the fly.
      # https://flexx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Castella #  is a pure Python cross-platform UI framework made for us Pythonista.
         # https://i2y.github.io/castella/
htag # GUI toolkit for building GUI toolkits (and create beautiful applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single python3 codebase),
     # which render nativly in anything which can render html/js/css.
     # Interesting History and experinces from other tools like :
     # Guy (https://github.com/manatlan/guy), Python-eel (), remi (https://github.com/rawpython/remi) and gtag (https://github.com/manatlan/gtag)
     # as Alternative for Runner 
     # For a desktop app : You can use the PyWebView runner, which will run the UI in a pywebview container (or "ChromeApp runner", in a local chrome app mode). 
     # For a web app : You can use the WebHTTP runner, which will run the UI in a web server, and serve the UI on client side, in a browser. 
     # For a android app : You can use the AndroidApp runner, which will run the UI in a kiwi webview thru tornado webserver, and can be embedded in an apk (recipes)
     # For a pyscript app : you can use the PyScript runner, which will run completly in client side

# ==== Game Engines and 3D =====
pygbag # python wasm for everyone ( packager + test server ). Runs python code directly in modern web browsers, including mobile versions. 
# pyp5js # Python to P5.js Transcriptor. https://pypi.org/project/pyp5js/ . MyNotes: pyp5js works like server and template generator. & not updated to use latest Jinja
# P5 # P5 is a Python library that provides high level drawing functionality to help you quickly create simulations and interactive art using Python. 
   # My Notes: P5 looks better than pyp5js in term of usability in Jupyter notebook # it have depedency on vispy
ipyp5 #  p5.js Jupyter Widget. My Notes: ipyp5 is old , but can be handy 
Enpyre # is an open-source library to render 2D games made with Python in React with graphics by PIXI.js and the power of Pyodide, WASM, and modern web technologies.
#wasm-spec-kernel # A Jupyter kernel for the Wasm reference interpreter  # This degrade Jupyterlite new feature based on JupyterLab
wasmpy # Interactions between WebAssembly and Python
pywasm3 # Python bindings for Wasm3, the fastest WebAssembly interpreter
